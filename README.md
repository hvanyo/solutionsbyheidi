## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed locally:
- NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
  - We are currently using the LTS version 12.19.0.
  - We use `npm` as a package manager. If you prefer `yarn` feel free to try it.
    YMMV.

## Creating a New Site

BodilessJS provides a Gatsby starter you can use as the basis of a new site.
Currently, you must install it from the main repository as follows:

[Create a New Starter Site](https://johnsonandjohnson.github.io/Bodiless-JS/#/About/GettingStarted?id=creating-a-new-site)

For this site: 
```
git clone https://github.com/hvanyo/solutionsbyheidi
```

You can then launch the editor:

```
cd /path/to/new/site
npm i
npm start
```

And view the site at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Click the
"docs" button (in the upper left corner) to view all documentation, or just
visit http://localhost:8000/___docs](http://localhost:8000/___docs).

To build and serve the production version of the site:

```
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Visit http://localhost:9000/ in your browser to view the site.
#### Start the Editing Site and add the Logo
Start your site with:
```
npm start
```
and view the site at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Click the Edit icon in toolbar.

Click on the image and you will see context menu that lets you set the image and
alt text for your logo.

For further details we highly recommend visiting the built in documentation:

Click the Docs icon in toolbar or visit
[(http://localhost:8000/___docs/#/Development/Guides/BuildingSites/) to read
more in-depth on how to start building a site.

Then continue on in Edit mode and start adding menu items, new pages, adding
content & update footer and start building your site.

Click the Docs icon in toolbar or visit
[(http://localhost:8000/___docs/#/Development/ContentEditor/) and read
more in-depth of using the editor to build your site.
